# Talks

Swift Dev Ninjas Meetup Talks

Whenever one of our meetup members is presenting a talk we try to record that talk and publish the talk on YouTube.
This repository contains slides, example projects and additional talks.
The recorded video is hosted on YouTube channel - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71zN3ko4j_9ywDrdsI8kDA.

## Contributing guideline

1. Create a new folder for every talk. Name the folder with "talk_date_title_by_author_first_name" for example, "2019_01_18_Assetless_by_Wolfgang".

2. Update the section "List of Talks".

3. Upload the talk on YouTube channel -  https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71zN3ko4j_9ywDrdsI8kDA.
